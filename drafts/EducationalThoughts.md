There is some criticism about the failure of our educational system to produce the kids of employees companies need in a fast-moving, highly technological era. 

That may be true, but it is not the whole story. 

In complaining about “education” business leaders forget about “learning,” the more important process. 

Learning occurs while doing, that is, working and then reflecting on it. 

Reflecting requires a culture of trust and security, both of which are lacking in today’s corporate world.

All the math, science, art — whatever — education in the world won't provide the “right” kind of employees that are critical to success in today’s flat world unless we all also cultivate human potential.

Isn’t that really the important point of “education” anyway — to cultivate the future potential of students?
