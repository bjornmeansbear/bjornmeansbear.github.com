1. Drinking pitchers should never be ridged on the inside. They are then impossible to clean.

2. Remote control designers: what the hell are you doing!?
Why does every remote have to be different and strange and then work differently depending on application??? What is with all the weird shapes and plastic-y crap?

3. Battery covers need to be harder to knock loose and lose.
