<p class="meta">26 Jan 2013 - Stone Hill, Baltimore, MD</p>

I am in the process of switching a bunch of my web-related stuff to a github managed workflow. This not only includes tracking changes via github, but also hosting a number of sites using their github-pages hosting as well as their Jekyll static site generator. I just need to figure out how it works a little more however.

_update 2/11/2013:_ I’m really quite happy with how this is going so far… I’m told that Ruhoh is actually the way to go, but this is a good start. It certainly makes working with text posts easier, and now I just need to figure out how to host a portfolio site using Jekyll.
