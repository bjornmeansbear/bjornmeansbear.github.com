How do we use what already exists and how do we create and maintain flexibility so that new buildings and old buildings can  maintain their uniqueness but also be a part?

The question on my mind is "what makes a signage system sustainable?" I propose to answer this by using a systematic approach auditing existing signage, collateral and materials to create a flexible kit of parts for present and future implementation. The campus is already host to a diverse range of building types and styles that contain a range of way finding solutions. My goal is to create a flexible, sustainable solution that not only updates and unifies all the existing signage, but provides a kit of parts for developing future materials â€¦
