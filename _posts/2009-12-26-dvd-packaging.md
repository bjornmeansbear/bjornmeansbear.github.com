My family recently exchanged christmas gifts and several DVD's were given out. What's the deal with the new DVD packages? The stupid sleeve over the plastic case that duplicates the printed matter ON the plastic case …

Also, WTF is up with DVD cases anyway? I realize that originally it was too be the same height as a VHS tape. But now it doesn't make much sense. There is so much extra plastic on those things. At least the giant cardboard container of the original CD packages served somewhat of a purpose—so CDs could still fit in Record shelves. And it was at least made of cardboard… or those reusable plastic holders.
