How about I start trying to collect my thoughts here? Should I make this where I start writing my essays? I could then at least use [IA writer](http://www.iawriter.com/ "IA Writer") and simple text files for most of it; easily transferred to any other medium after that.

I’ve got a lot of essays started already in different places[^1]. The first thing to do is probably try and get them onto here. Cool.
