Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it has always been this way, but I cannot remember as a kid a celebrity endorsement on every single object available for sale. I mean, really Gordon Ramsay, do you need your name on discount kitchen electronics and cheap knives? I know why Kmart would want your name on their equipment, but I cannot fathom why you would want your fine dining reputation connected with Kmart? Bobby Flay, have you not been able to bring in enough covers at your restaurant? I can think of no other explanation for why you’d be putting your name on cheap, stamped, crap knives from China and selling them at Kohl’s otherwise. Bizarre.
