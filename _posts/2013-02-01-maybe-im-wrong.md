Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it has always been this way, but I cannot remember as a kid a celebrity endorsements on every single object available for sale. 
I mean, really, Gordon Ramsay, do you need your name on discount kitchen electronics and cheap knifes?
Now, I know why Kmart would want your name on their equipment, but why would you want your fine dining reputation connected with Kmart? 
Bizarre.
