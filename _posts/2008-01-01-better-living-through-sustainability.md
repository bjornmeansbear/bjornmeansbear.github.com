This phrase rings out as a new way to view the issues of sustainability. It also works on several levels. It subverts the old DuPont slogan from the 30’s: “Better Things for Better Living ... Through Chemistry” (the phrase has, through use in popular culture and media, become better known as “better living through chemistry”). The phrase also changes the way sustainability is perceived — no longer is sustainability a sacrifice. “Better Living through Sustainability” makes it clear that sustainability betters everyone’s lives. I believe in technology, I believe in American innovation, and so does this slogan. Better Living Through Sustainability is a starting point for a myriad of other ventures: writings, branding strategies, installations, etc. and I will follow and spread the message in every way that I can.
