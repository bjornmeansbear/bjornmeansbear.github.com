Okay, I am really tired of hearing how Solar and Wind are non-carbon solutions. Listen you have to BUILD the things. That takes energy. It takes mining. It takes environmental impact. It takes transportation. It takes diesel. There definitely is still going to be carbon-dioxide production in the process of making, transporting, and installing solar panels, wind turbines, and small scale hydro devices. Now, I am not saying that I don't prefer these solutions, and that they are definitely to be desired over Coal-fired power plants. I'm just saying we need to stop pretending that these things don't also have a manufacturing footprint. That is all, rant over.
