Who knew a pile of stacked, pitched roof boxes could be so amazing.

This is one of the few new buildings I have seen that really impresses me and extends my imagination for what a structure can be. All by taking a standard, vernacular shape and using it wonderfully. It doesn't seem weird that there are no windows except at the truncated ends. The shots @ night are especially spectacular. Truly the perfect place for a home furniture showroom.
