I just want to post a few things, then link them together, and put whatever I need up at any given time… in my mind this is so easy; why so hard using a web framework? Hopefully this will be much easier…[^1]

[^1]: I wrote this when I started testing out scriptogr.am, however, even it wasn’t really that much more convenient to post too than anything else … so this version is now on github pages and powered by their Jekyll software. So far this is the best experience in writing, editing, theming, and posting I have had.
