Part of what makes design so un-sustainable is all the wasted packaging associated with most goods. Puma has decided to try and attack that head on with a new [shoe-box/bag system](http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2010/4/13/puma-and-yves-behars-new-green-packaging.html). 

This isn't particularly new anymore. Images and discussions about this have been hopping around the internet for months now. However, people are still talking about how great this is, but have not brought up the point that the BAG part of the equation is still a disposable, derelict item once the shoes get brought home.

So, my question is this: is the bag returnable to the shoe store? 
Perhaps there should be a deposit on the bag, and then you exchange it for a small discount on the next pair of pumas. This works for local dairy and beer sellers using returnable, glass bottles — why not for shoe boxes? It could foster brand loyalty, or at least the small glimmer of a *discount* to encourage a future sale.

Also, it uses a proven model for effectively reusing things … just a thought.
