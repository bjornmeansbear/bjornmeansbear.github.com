My personal feeling is that open source communities and creative-commons licensing are part of the way  innovation and design will most quickly move forward. They are themselves sustainable practices that build upon themselves. They also democratize the ability of people to access them. With that in mind it is nice to read that some rather large companies are sharing the ideal. [GreenXchange][] attempts to do just this, and two of its largest current supporters are Nike and Best Buy. Not bad.
