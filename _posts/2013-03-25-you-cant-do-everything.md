You can’t do everything. You must learn to accept this.
You must understand and come to terms with the fact that there are only so many hours, so many days, so many years, and only so many experiences one can have. Pick the good ones. Pick the ones that lead to more cool stuff. Pick the ones that lead to more of the stuff you are interested in. If you can, leave the rest behind. This means that you cannot necessarily master all the things you want to master AND still get the work you have to get done completed. This is sad, but it is also a truth that you must come to grips with.

You can’t do everything. You must learn to accept this.
I know it is hard, I mean, I am having this conversation with myself.

You can’t do everything. You must learn to accept this.
When I say you I really (also) mean I.
