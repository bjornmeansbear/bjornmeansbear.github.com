As a designer, my job is to make stuff. Usually a lot of stuff. Ephemeral stuff. Often stuff that soon becomes trash. As a sustainabilitist, I want to make and consume less stuff. How do I reconcile these two extremes? Making better stuff, adaptable stuff, non-replaceable stuff is part of the solution. Another is asking the question “Does this make the present (& future) measurably better?” For most stuff, my designs included, the answer is no. But, for sustainability's sake, the answer must be yes.
